# Introduction
A local dental practice struggled with managing appointments efficiently, leading to long wait times and frustrated patients. Therefore I wanted to try my hand at creating a chatbot to address this issue.

To develop an automated dental appointment booking system that could handle patient inquiries and schedule appointments 24/7.

I architected a chatbot utilising Amazon Connect for omnichannel communication, Lex for natural language processing, and Lambda for backend logic. To manage appointment data, I implemented DynamoDB, ensuring efficient querying and real-time updates. I streamlined the development process by employing Terraform and CloudFormation for infrastructure management, and set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. To enhance user experience, I integrated the chatbot functionality into a custom frontend with interactive UI components.

The chatbot successfully automated 80% of appointment bookings, significantly reducing wait times and improving patient satisfaction. This project not only solved the practiceâ€™s immediate problem but also honed my skills in cloud-based application development.
